Server_Application - this class acts as a facilitator between the client and the database. It contains methods to retrieve information from the database and return it in a format usable by the client. It also contains methods to add/update/delete users from the database, and to add an amount to a user's balance. Finally, it contains logic (called periodically by the system) to query the database for user activities which were not validated and occurred in the past - and to deduct accordingly from the user's balance.
