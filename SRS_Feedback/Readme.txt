Positiove feedback :

A)  Figures are easily readable and effectively visualize the concepts described in the associated paragraphs.

B)  The Use Cases are well defined and are easy to read. 

C)  I like the fact that the process includes a Change Management Process, to handle issues that might arise during the project development and specifies the process in which to handle such changes.

Negative feedback:

A)  TOC does not give page numbers or hyperlink to appropriate sections. No easy way to find specific information specified in TOC without searching for outline number.

B)  Under 1.3.2 System Definitions and 1.3.3 Human Trafficking Definitions, text is not centered within the cells and is unreadable of the table.

C)  There are minor formatting issues, i.e. the table name for table 2.1 is on another page than the table itself, etc.
